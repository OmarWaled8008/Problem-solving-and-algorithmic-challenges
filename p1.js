// ðŸ“¨ Task Description: "Was the Package Received the Day Before It Was Sent?"
// You're given a simplified model of time zones and package delivery. A package is sent from one time zone to another, starting at a specific local hour and taking a certain number of hours to be delivered.
// Your task is to determine whether the package was received on the previous day relative to when it was sent â€” from the perspective of local time at the destination.
// The purpose of this function is to determine whether a package was received on the previous calendar day (in local time at the destination) relative to when it was sent (in local time at the origin).
