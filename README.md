# üöÄ 100 Problem-Solving Challenge (Hard Coding Only)

This repository is part of my personal challenge to **solve 100 algorithmic and logical problems in JavaScript without relying on built-in functions** (as much as possible).  

The main goal is to **strengthen problem-solving skills**, understand how things work under the hood, and improve raw coding ability by implementing logic manually.

## üìñ Rules of the Challenge
1. **No Built-in Shortcuts**  
   - Write logic step by step (hard coding).  
2. **Focus on Fundamentals**  
   - Use loops, conditions, and recursion when needed.  
   - Re-implement commonly used operations if required.  
3. **Clarity over Optimization**  
   - Priority is on understanding and explaining the logic.  
   - Optimizations can be added later.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Structure
- **`index.html`** ‚Üí Launcher page with buttons from Problem 1 to 100. Clicking a button loads the respective solution dynamically.
- **`p1.js, p2.js, p3.js, ...`** ‚Üí Each file contains one problem solution.
- Example problems:
  - QuickSort implementation  
  - Reverse words without using `reverse()`  
  - Uppercase string check  
  - Merge arrays and manual duplicate removal  
  - Time zone package delivery calculation  
  - and more...

## üéØ Goal
By the end of this challenge:
- Build **100+ raw-coded solutions** without shortcuts.
- Strengthen **algorithmic thinking**.
- Gain confidence in solving problems without relying on libraries or built-ins.
